PROJECT 4 - EDIBLE VS POISONOUS MUSHROOM CLASSIFICATION

---

REPOSITORY Guide:

---

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Objective: train a machine learning model to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible.

The project utilized both K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest algorithms for classification.

---

DATASET 

This dataset includes 61069 hypothetical mushrooms with caps based on 173 species (353 mushrooms
per species). This dataset was created by D. Wagner, D. Heider and G. Hattab, and obtained from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/848/secondary+mushroom+dataset). The dataset includes metadata columns such as:
  * cap-diameter
  * cap-shape
  * does-bruise-bleed
  * gill-attachment
  * gill-spacing
  * gill-color
  * stem-height

METHODOLOGY

The project follows these key steps:

1. DATA MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
   *A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model
   *The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling
   *The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark
   *The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared.

2. DATA MODEL OPTIMIZATION
   *The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself
   *Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script

RESULTS

Training of both the KNN and Random Forest classifiers was successful.

* The KNN model was trained to achieve: 0.999 accuracy, 0.999 recall and 0.999 precision.
* The Random Forest model was able to achieve: 1.0 accuracy, 1.0 recall and 1.0 precision.
