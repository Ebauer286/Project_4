PROJECT 4 - EDIBLE VS POISONOUS MUSHROOM CLASSIFICATION

---

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repository contains a Supervised Machine Learning solution utilizing the "Secondary Mushroom" dataset to classify mushrooms into an edible or poisonous classification.  

---

DATASET 

The analysis uses a dataset of  61,069 rows of simulated mushroom data. This data set was obtained from UC Irving (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/848/secondary+mushroom+dataset). The dataset includes metadata columns such as:
  *cap-diameter
  *cap-shape
  *does-bruise-bleed
  *gill-attachment
  *gill-spacing
  *gill-color
  *stem-height
  *stem_width
  *stem-root
  *stem-surface
  *stem-color
  *veil-type
  *veil-color
  *has-ring
  *ring-type
  *spore-print-color
  *habitat
  *seasons

METHODOLOGY

The project follows these key steps:

1. DATA MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
   *A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model
   *The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling
   *The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark
   *The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared.

2. DATA MODEL OPTIMIZATION
   *The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself
   *Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script
